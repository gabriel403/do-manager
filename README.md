Digital Ocean Manager
==========

This is a simple front end that uses AJAX requests to communicate with the Digital Ocean API (v2).

All it needs is a simple webserver to run and contains no backend.

No information is stored by the host.

Add an access token to your [Digital Ocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications)
account and enter the token in the input box at the top of the [DO Manager webpage](https://do.prowl.io) and select your starting point from the dropdown.

Actions will become available as context changes.
